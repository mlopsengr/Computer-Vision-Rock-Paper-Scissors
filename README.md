# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors
## Milestone 1
- An image project model for classifying four different classes "Rock", "paper", "Scissors", and "Nothing" using a "Teachable-Machine", an open source image model creation site.
- The model is downloaded, which includes two files "keras_model.h5" and "labels.txt", the former containing the structure and parameters of the deep learning model built and the later housing information on the labels which are the classes the model was built to identify.
