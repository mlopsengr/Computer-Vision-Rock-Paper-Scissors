# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors
## Milestone 1
- An image project model for classifying four different classes "Rock", "paper", "Scissors", and "Nothing" using a "Teachable-Machine", an open source image model creation site.
- The model is downloaded, which includes two files "keras_model.h5" and "labels.txt", the former containing the structure and parameters of the deep learning model built and the later housing information on the labels which are the classes the model was built to identify.

## Milestone 2
- The dependencies for the project are installed in an environment called "my_env", making use of conda

## Milstone 3
- Making use of if else statements, the method that defines and displays the winner is implemented.
- This function is also within the game class and therefore a method of that class.
